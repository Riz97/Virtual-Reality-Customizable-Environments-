# Master-Thesis


This thesis aims to exploit generative language models to create customized virtual reality environments.
In many fields of application, such as exergames for cognitive or physical training, one of the main issues is to create a wide range of simulated situations, thus avoiding the onset of boredom and habituation phenomena. However, creating many simulated situations may be a long and tedious task. 
This thesis aims to cope with this issue, creating a framework for generating different virtual reality scenarios described in natural language. The framework will allow unskilled people to add virtual scenarios and simulations to existing sw, such as cognitive exergames.
The student will analyse the use of generative language models (e.g. chatgpt) and their use to create virtual environments (e.g., in Unity).
A further development will be the combination with real-world elements, detected in real-time, to create dynamic environments where virtual and real objects coexist.
