FIRST PART

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for code generation can be used to transform a natural language request for a virtual world into reality. The main objective of this thesis is to utilize LLMs to generate custom virtual environments tailored to user requests. In recent years, AI models have achieved remarkable levels of reliability when responding to inquiries. Therefore, we intend to exploit these models and provide users with a framework that can overcome the problem of creating different environments for various situations with minimal effort. Our goal is to enable the construction of environments using natural language, making the framework accessible to individuals outside the realm of computer science. The possibilities for custom-designed VRs are virtually limitless. For instance, a physiotherapist could request a virtual environment that is tuned to the needs of a patient with an unusual injury. Students in a laboratory could inspect, analyse, and become familiar with materials or machines that they might not have access to because of budget constraints, safety concerns, or physical limitations. Furthermore, without the support of a framework like this, building the environment would be a boring and tedious task that must be repeated hundreds of times.
