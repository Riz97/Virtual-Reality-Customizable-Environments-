The script generated by the AI is the following: 
 
using UnityEngine;

public class ReplaceModels : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // STEP ONE - Find with the GameObject.Find method, not FindObjectsByTag, one time per gameobject, and they are called Model_0 Model_1 Model_2 Model_3 and destroy them
        GameObject[] models = new GameObject[] { GameObject.Find("Model_0"), GameObject.Find("Model_1"), GameObject.Find("Model_2"), GameObject.Find("Model_3") };
        foreach (GameObject model in models)
        {
            Destroy(model);
        }

        // STEP TWO - Substitute them with the objects loaded from the Resources/Nature
        models[0] = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Nature/Pine Oak");
        models[1] = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Nature/Pine Oak");
        models[2] = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Nature/Pine");
        models[3] = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Nature/Oak");

        // STEP THREE - Rename the new models with .name in the following way Model_0, Model_1, Model_2, Model_3
        models[0].name = "Model_0";
        models[1].name = "Model_1";
        models[2].name = "Model_2";
        models[3].name = "Model_3";

        // STEP FOUR - The positions for every objects are the following and are ALL mandatory to be inserted in the script as float, do not truncate the code:
        models[0].transform.position = new Vector3(-8.080366f, -0.47f, 19.08892f);
        models[1].transform.position = new Vector3(-8.9962f, -0.47f, 15.31984f);
        models[2].transform.position = new Vector3(-8.739289f, -0.47f, 27.19049f);
        models[3].transform.position = new Vector3(-8.678557f, -0.47f, 27.98628f);

        // STEP FIVE - Find with the Find() method the gameobject 'Plane' and change its material with the following code Resources.Load<Material>(Nature/Material)
        GameObject plane = GameObject.Find("Plane");
        plane.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = Resources.Load<Material>("Nature/Material");

        // STEP SIX - Add a boxcollider per gameobject
        foreach (GameObject model in models)
        {
            BoxCollider collider = model.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
            collider.size = new Vector3(1, 1, 1);
        }
    }
}
