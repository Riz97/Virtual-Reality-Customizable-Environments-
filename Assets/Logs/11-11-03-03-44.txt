        // STEP FOUR - Find with the Find() method the gameobject  'Plane' and change its material with the following code Resources.Load<Material>(Nature/Material)
        GameObject plane = GameObject.Find("Plane");
        Material naturalMaterial = Resources.Load<Material>("Nature/Material");

        Collider collider2 = model2.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();

        // STEP SIX - I cannot touch to code so you must not truncate the code by saying for example 'and so on for all models'
