using UnityEngine;

public class ModelReplacer : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // STEP ONE - Find with the GameObject.Find method, not FindObjectsByTag, one time per gameobjects, and they are called Model_0 Model_1 Model_2 Model_3 and destroy them
        GameObject model0 = GameObject.Find("Model_0");
        GameObject model1 = GameObject.Find("Model_1");
        GameObject model2 = GameObject.Find("Model_2");
        GameObject model3 = GameObject.Find("Model_3");
        Destroy(model0);
        Destroy(model1);
        Destroy(model2);
        Destroy(model3);
        
        // STEP TWO - Substitute them with the objects loaded from the Resources/Nature the gameobjects to be uploaded are : 'Oak' 'Oak' 'Pine' 'Pine' in the same way is written here Resources.Load<GameObject>("Nature/nameoftheobject")
        GameObject oak = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Oak");
        GameObject pine = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Pine");
        
        // STEP THREE - In the third step, it is mandatory to rename the freshly created models with .name in the following way Model_0 Model_1 Model_2 Model_3
        model0.name = "Model_0";
        model1.name = "Model_1";
        model2.name = "Model_2";
        model3.name = "Model_3";
        
        // STEP FOUR - The positions for every objects are the following and are ALL mandatory to be inserted in the script as float, do not truncate the code: Model_0 is a Oak at Vector3(-2.089609,-0.47,24.59437) Model_1 is a Oak at Vector3(-3.040284,-0.47,5.440282) Model_2 is a Pine at Vector3(-8.646732,-0.47,23.36021) Model_3 is a Pine at Vector3(9.483477,-0.47,9.412234)
        model0.transform.position = new Vector3(-2.089609f, -0.47f, 24.59437f);

        model3.transform.position = new Vector3(9.483477f, -0.47f, 9.412234f);
        
        // STEP FIVE - Find with the Find() method the gameobject 'Plane' and change its material with the following code Resources.Load<Material>(Nature/Material)
        GameObject plane = GameObject.Find("Plane");
        plane.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = Resources.Load<Material>("Nature/Material");
        
        // STEP SIX - add a boxcollider per gameobject
        model0.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        model1.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        model2.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        model3.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
