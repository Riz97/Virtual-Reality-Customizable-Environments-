The script generated by the AI is the following: 
 using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectManipulation : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        // Step One - Find and change the material of the 'Plane' object
        GameObject plane = GameObject.Find("Plane");
        Material newMaterial = Resources.Load<Material>("Furniture/Material");
        plane.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = newMaterial;

        // Step Two - Find and destroy the 'Model_0' and 'Model_1' objects
        GameObject model0 = GameObject.Find("Model_0");
        GameObject model1 = GameObject.Find("Model_1");
        Destroy(model0);
        Destroy(model1);

        // Step Three - Instantiate new objects from the Resources/Furniture folder
        GameObject chairPrefab = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Furniture/Chair");
        GameObject tablePrefab = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Furniture/Table");

        GameObject chair = Instantiate(chairPrefab);
        GameObject table = Instantiate(tablePrefab);

        // Step Four - Rename the freshly created models
        chair.name = "Model_0";
        table.name = "Model_1";

        // Step Five - Set the positions for the objects
        chair.transform.position = new Vector3(-2.142224f, -0.47f, 24.23085f);
        table.transform.position = new Vector3(-2.142224f, -0.47f, 24.23085f);

        // Step Six - Add a BoxCollider to every object
        BoxCollider chairCollider = chair.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        BoxCollider tableCollider = table.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
