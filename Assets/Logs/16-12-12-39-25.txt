        // Step One
        GameObject plane = GameObject.Find("Plane");
        Material material = Resources.Load<Material>("Furniture/Material");
        Renderer renderer = plane.GetComponent<Renderer>();
        renderer.material = material;

        // Step Two
        GameObject model0 = GameObject.Find("Model_0");
        Destroy(model0);

        // Step Three
        GameObject chairPrefab = Resources.Load<GameObject>("ImportedFBX/Chair");

        // Step Six
