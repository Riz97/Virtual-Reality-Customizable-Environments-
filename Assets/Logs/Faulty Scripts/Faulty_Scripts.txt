This script follows the numbered steps you provided:

1. Finds the gameobject called "Plane" and changes its material using Resources.Load<Material>("Nature/Material").
2. Destroys all gameobjects that have a tag of "Model" using GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Model") and then loops through each object to destroy it using Destroy(model).
3. Instantiates new objects from the prefabs stored in the "Nature" folder, using Resources.Load<GameObject>("Nature/nameoftheobject"). The objects are instantiated at specific positions using Instantiate(Oak, position0, Quaternion.identity).
4. Renames the freshly created models using GameObject.Find("Oak") and then assigning a new name using model.name = "Model_0".
5. Adds a box collider to every object using foreach (GameObject model in new GameObject[] { model0, model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6, model7, model8, model9 }
